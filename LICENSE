Covered Work – Any Derivative Work or any other work that:
a) Implements or reproduces a substantial part of the unique structure, sequence, organization, data formats, APIs, command interfaces, or non-functional elements of the Licensed Material; or
b) Is developed, directly or indirectly, with reference to the Licensed Material; or
c) Infringes, or would infringe absent this License, any Patent Claim held by You that reads on the Licensed Material or any Derivative Work.

Affiliate – Any entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another entity.

Use – To utilize, execute, operate, reproduce, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, sell, make available, or otherwise employ the Licensed Material or any Covered Work, including deployment via cloud, network, or remote services.

You – The licensee or recipient of rights under this License.

Intellectual Property Right – Any patent, copyright, trademark, moral right, trade secret, or any other form of intellectual property recognized under applicable law.

2. Acceptance

By receiving, using, copying, modifying, or distributing the Licensed Material, You agree to all terms of this License as a binding contract between You and each Licensor. If You do not agree, You must not Use the Licensed Material.

3. Grant of Rights

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, You are granted a worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable, non-exclusive license to:
a) Use, reproduce, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, sell, and claim authorship of the Licensed Material and any Covered Work;
b) Apply for, obtain, hold, and enforce Intellectual Property Rights covering the Licensed Material or any Covered Work, provided such rights are exercised solely to preserve the freedoms granted under this License and never to restrict them.

4. Covenant Not to Assert

You, on behalf of Yourself, Affiliates, successors, assigns, and any entity under common control, irrevocably covenant not to assert, enforce, or threaten to enforce any Intellectual Property Right against any person or entity for exercising rights granted by this License with respect to the Licensed Material or any Covered Work.

5. Patent License

If You own or control any Patent Claim that would be infringed by the Licensed Material or any Covered Work, You grant a worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable license to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import, run, modify, and distribute such works to the extent necessary to exercise the rights granted herein.

6. Copyleft – Viral Inheritance

Any Covered Work You distribute, make available, or deploy must:
a) Be licensed in full under this License or a later official version;
b) Include a conspicuous and legible copy of this License;
c) Preserve all original notices, disclaimers, and attribution.

No additional restrictions may be imposed by contract, DRM, technical measures, or legal terms that limit the freedoms granted here.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty

The Licensed Material is provided “AS IS,” without warranties of any kind. No contributor or licensor shall be liable for any damages arising from Use of the Licensed Material.

8. Termination

Any violation of Section 4 (Covenant Not to Assert) or Section 6 (Copyleft) automatically and permanently terminates Your rights under this License. Rights previously granted to third parties remain unaffected.

9. Severability and Governing Law

If any provision of this License is held unenforceable, the remainder shall remain in effect. This License applies worldwide, and disputes shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction of the defendant, unless both parties agree otherwise.

Summary of Enforceability Improvements:

“Functionally Equivalent Work” replaced with Covered Work, tied to copyright-protectable elements and patents.

Explicit contract acceptance for extra legal standing.

Patent clause covers equivalent implementations to close loopholes.

Still strong anti-assertion and copyleft.
