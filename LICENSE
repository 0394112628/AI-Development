1. Definitions
“Licensed Material” means the source code, object code, or other work distributed under this License.

“Derivative Work” means any work based on, incorporating, modifying, translating, adapting, merging, or otherwise using the Licensed Material, in whole or in part.

“Functionally Equivalent” means any work that performs substantially the same purpose and achieves substantially the same result as the Licensed Material or a Derivative Work, regardless of differences in form, implementation, or expression.

“Affiliate” means any entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another entity.

“Use” includes internal operation, public deployment, modification, reproduction, distribution, or making available to others.

2. Grant of Rights
You are granted a worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable, non-exclusive license to:
a. Use, reproduce, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, sell, or claim authorship of the Licensed Material and Derivative Works.
b. Apply for or hold patents, copyrights, or trademarks covering the Licensed Material or Derivative Works, provided such rights are never asserted to restrict others from exercising rights under this License.

3. Covenant Not to Assert
You, on behalf of yourself and your Affiliates, successors, assigns, and any entity under common control, covenant not to assert any Patent Claim, Copyright, Trademark, or other legal right:
a. Against any person or entity for using, making, modifying, distributing, or selling the Licensed Material, any Derivative Work, or any Functionally Equivalent work; or
b. In any manner that would interfere with or limit the rights granted under this License.
This covenant is perpetual, worldwide, binding on all successors and assigns, and survives any transfer of rights.

4. Patent License Fallback
If any jurisdiction finds Section 3 unenforceable, you grant a worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable license under any Patent Claim you control that would be infringed by the Licensed Material, any Derivative Work, or any Functionally Equivalent work, to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import, run, modify, and distribute such works.

5. Viral Inheritance
Any Derivative Work or distribution of the Licensed Material must:
a. Be licensed under this License without additional restrictions; and
b. Include a conspicuous copy of this License in all copies and substantial portions of the Licensed Material.

6. No Additional Restrictions
You may not impose legal terms, technological measures, or contractual conditions that restrict others from exercising rights granted here.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty and Liability
The Licensed Material is provided “AS IS,” without warranty of any kind.
No contributor shall be liable for any damages arising in any way from the use of the Licensed Material.

8. Termination
Any violation of Section 3 or Section 5 automatically and permanently terminates your rights under this License.
Upon termination, you must immediately cease all use and distribution of the Licensed Material and Derivative Works, unless separately licensed by the copyright holder.

9. Severability and Governing Law
If any provision of this License is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full force and effect.
This License applies worldwide. Any dispute shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the defendant resides, unless both parties agree otherwise.
