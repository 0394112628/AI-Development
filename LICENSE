Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, You are hereby granted a worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable, non-exclusive license to:

a. Use, reproduce, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, sell, or claim authorship of the Licensed Material and Derivative Works;

b. Apply for, obtain, hold, and enforce patents, copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights covering the Licensed Material or Derivative Works, provided that such rights are exercised solely to preserve the freedoms granted under this License and are never asserted in a manner that restricts or limits the rights of others under this License.

3. Covenant Not to Assert
You, on behalf of Yourself, Your Affiliates, successors, assigns, and any entity under common control, hereby irrevocably covenant and agree that You will not, nor will You authorize, assist, or encourage any third party to:

This covenant is perpetual, worldwide, binding on all successors, assigns, and licensees, and survives any transfer of rights or ownership.

4. Patent License Fallback
If any court or competent authority finds any provision of Section 3 unenforceable under applicable law, You hereby grant a worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, non-exclusive license under any Patent Claim You control that would otherwise be infringed by the Licensed Material, any Derivative Work, or any Functionally Equivalent Work, to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import, run, modify, and distribute such works to the extent necessary to exercise the rights granted by this License.

5. Viral Inheritance
Any Derivative Work or distribution of the Licensed Material must:

a. Be licensed under this License or a later version without imposing any additional restrictions that limit the rights granted hereunder;

b. Include a conspicuous and legible copy of this License with all copies or substantial portions of the Licensed Material or Derivative Works;

c. Preserve all original copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices, disclaimers, and this License text.

6. No Additional Restrictions
You may not impose, or permit to be imposed, any legal terms, technological measures (including digital rights management or DRM), contractual conditions, or any other restrictions that would restrict, limit, or prevent others from exercising any rights granted under this License.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability
The Licensed Material is provided on an “AS IS” basis, without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or accuracy.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, no contributor or licensor shall be liable for any damages, whether direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive, arising out of or related to the use or inability to use the Licensed Material, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

8. Termination
Any violation of Section 3 (Covenant Not to Assert) or Section 5 (Viral Inheritance) shall automatically and permanently terminate Your rights under this License.

Upon termination, You must immediately cease all use, distribution, and exploitation of the Licensed Material and any Derivative Works unless separately licensed by the copyright holder.

Termination does not affect rights granted to any third party who received the Licensed Material or Derivative Works from You prior to termination.

9. Severability and Governing Law
If any provision of this License is held invalid, unenforceable, or illegal by a court or competent authority, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

This License applies worldwide.

Any dispute arising from or relating to this License shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the defendant resides, unless both parties agree otherwise.

Parties are encouraged to seek amicable resolution or alternative dispute resolution prior to commencing litigation.
